Our challenge is to build a ticking clock:
- The clock needs to display hours, minutes, seconds, and time of day in civilian time. 
- Each filed must always have double digits, meaning leading zeros to be applied to single-digit values like 1 or 2.
- The clock must also tick and change the display every second.

## How to run
- Use `node ./functional_solution.js` or `node ./imperative_solution.js` to run the js files.
